# Summary
As requested the use case in the exercise is implemented in a generic way such that discounts can easily be created and applied to bills. The main test cases are in
[DiscountsCotrollerTest]

# Coding exercise:

On a retail website, the following discounts apply: 
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount 
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount 
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. 
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). 
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. 
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
